_This blog post is a result of my counter-rant in a discussion on programming languages we had during a recent exoplanet atmosphere modelling workshop. It is my personal view, supported by about 6 years of using and occasionally teaching Python. This post will probably be outdated in a few years. Also note I'm not advocating for a complete rewrite of climate models and huge chunks of other legacy code in Python._ 

I understand some of my colleagues' experience with Python can be not as good as it has been for me and many other people. I believe that as things stand, Python is the best language for doing science because of the following (equally important) reasons.

1. It is free and open-source. While for researchers at a major Western university there is no problem paying for a software license, it is a big hurdle for the rest of the world. License-based software raises unnecessary barriers and it's not just the cost itself (which can be [ridiculous](https://www.mathworks.com/pricing-licensing.html)), it's the perpetual need to update licenses or only being able to use the software once you are connected to the university's network and so on. Next, not everyone can pay for the license. The fact that Python is free makes it very easy to adopt in a wider scientific community and even in schools around the world. The latter then naturally makes it a language of choice further in students' career.
2. The problem of "reinventing the wheel" of translating lecacy codes to new languages can indeed be annoying. However, that's exactly what the (scientific) Python community is trying to avoid: you don't need to rewrite mathematical expressions from scratch - there are stable and well-tested libraries like [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), on which most of the scientific stack is built. And again, the fact that all libraries open-source makes it much easier to adopt them and develop them further as a community.
3. Sure Python is not always the fastest language, but it is definitely one of the most user-friendly languages. When people say Python is slow - even though it's not really slow if you know how to use it - I like to quote this analogy (Disclaimer: I'm not the author): sure a fighter jet is faster than a car, but you don't fly a fighter jet to get groceries (I hope!). Furthermore, Python is flexible enough so that if you do encounter a bottleneck in performance you can pretty easily drop down to a lower-level specialised programming language like Fortran or C (or Cython). In other words, one of the major strengths of Python is that it's a great "glue" language. There are also a few libraries that do code optimisation or parallelisation at a higher level, e.g. [numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) and [dask](https://dask.org/). Finally, human time is always more valuable than machine's time: compare the time spent by a scientist writing a Python script compared to writing the same program in Fortran.
4. Thus, the strength of Python is not in its speed but in its flexibility, which comes from both the ability to interface between languages and from the wide community that has grown in the past decade. You can do pretty much anything with it. Do you want to write a script to plot netCDF data? Sure, use [xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/) or [iris](https://scitools.org.uk/iris) and it will take you a dozen lines of code maximum. Do you want to do some heavy computations? Wrap a snippet of Fortran code using f2py and import it as you import a regular library. Do you want to process images? No problem, there are powerful libraries like [scipy](https://www.scipy.org) or [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/). Do you want to make cool 3D plots of climate model output? Plenty of 3D viz packages (my favourite is [pyvista](https://www.pyvista.org/)). Do you want to fetch some data over FTP and feed it in your model? You only need to import the [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ftplib.html). Do you want to create a simple website for your research group? No problem, there are a bunch of easy-to-use static site generators (e.g. [pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/)). Do you want to build a GUI for your GCM? Again, plenty of [Python libraries](https://wiki.python.org/moin/GuiProgramming). Do you want to create interactive lecture notes for students? [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is your friend. Do you want to read and write Excel spreadsheets? No problem, use [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) or other libraries. And so on and so forth.
5. This versatility is of course easy to dismiss by saying that scientists don't need to do all these things. Perhaps not. But what is more important if such a language is adopted by the scientific community is that it gives scientists a valuable transferable skill - which is especially important for students who may not stay in academia. I think everybody can agree that teaching only Fortran, as important as it is, is not useful in this regard - nobody uses Fortran except for the Earth sciences & astronomy communities.
6. Regarding the versions 2 vs 3 of Python - yes, that was a bit of a mess. But at the moment it's sort of like comparing Fortran 77 to Fortran 90/2003: everybody has moved on to Python 3. Pretty much all scientific libraries are now ported to Python 3 and if you are still using Python 2, it's definitely time to switch (Python 2 has been [officially dead](https://pythonclock.org/) for 9 months now). Regarding the language standards, Python has widely adopted style standards (see [PEP8 guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)). They are not as strict as Fortran 77 standards, but I'd argue it's a benefit, especially for newcomers to programming.
7. This brings me to the next point. I don't agree that languages are becoming more difficult to use in terms of syntax. Don't get me wrong, I like Fortran's plain and simple syntax, but it is quite limited and clunky (especially when dealing with strings). I can't see how Python can be even more human-friendly than basically just typing `[process(this_thing) for this_thing in sequence_of_things if this_thing is in another_list]`. It's literally just spelling instructions in English. One of the things that makes Python slow is of course dynamic typing (you don't have to declare what type this variable is, you can change it on the fly). But this is also what makes Python's syntax so beginner-friendly.
8. Finally, if you feel intimidated by the whole ecosystem of Python libraries and worry about conflicts between them, there's now a great tool called [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) (as in Anaconda). It's a software package manager that allows you to get latest versions of thousands of scientific Python libraries and makes sure it's easy to install them without conflicts (big thanks to the awesome [conda-forge team](https://conda-forge.org/)).

To sum up, I think this is why Python has grown so rapidly and continues to grow in the scientific community, and rightly so. It's probably no coincidence some of the greatest recent discoveries were made with the help of Python, such as the [detection of gravitational waves with LIGO](https://blog.jupyter.org/congratulations-to-the-ligo-and-virgo-collaborations-from-project-jupyter-5923247be019) and [the first image of the black hole](https://numpy.org/case-studies/blackhole-image/).

If you can offer me a better language for my workflow, I'd be happy to switch. Of course, in 5-10 years another language will probably arise ([Julia](https://julialang.org/) looks like the best candidate) with even better qualities. But for now, Python is our best choice.
